# PL JAM #1

## OVERVIEW

The Corecursive #language-makers programming language jam is a

- low key
- small scope
- max creativity

opportunity to hack on a programming language.

## THEME

- @TODO

## SCHEDULE

### Week 1: design doc

Week #1 is primarily for thinking deeply and writing ideas down. This could
include

- description
- inspiration
- novel features
- example code

Submit a link to your design doc in #language-makers and tag your organizers
`@Jake` and `@Jason Steving`. We accept any reasonable format including github
READMEs and google docs.

To set yourself up for success please also think about how long implementation will take and include a week #2 roadmap.

### Week 2: implementation

In week #2 take a swing at implementing a runtime, interpreter, compiler, or
transpiler for your language. Compilers can take decades to write so nobody is
expecting the next python -- even getting even a single contrived program to run
is a huge accomplishment.

### Week 3

Relax and peruse your fellow language creator's languages while the judges
evaluate the submissions. At the end of the week we'll have a video call where
we'll announce the winning language and the prize!
