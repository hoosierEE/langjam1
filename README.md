# PL JAM #1

## OVERVIEW

The Corecursive #language-makers programming language jam is a

- low key
- small scope
- max creativity

opportunity to hack on a programming language.

## THEME

- @TODO

## SCHEDULE

### Week 1: design doc

Week #1 is primarily for thinking deeply and writing ideas down. This could
include

- description
- inspiration
- novel features
- example code

Submit a link to your design doc in #language-makers and tag your organizers
`@Jake` and `@Jason Steving`. We accept any reasonable format including github
READMEs and google docs.

### Week 2: implementation

In week #2 take a swing at implementing a runtime, interpreter, compiler, or
transpiler for your language. Compilers can take decades to write so nobody is
expecting the next python -- even getting even a single contrived program to run
is a huge accomplishment.

### week 3

The point of the jam is to share cool ideas so "judging" will be a group effort.
Jam organizers will share a spreadsheet in the #language-makers channel where
anybody (even non-jam participants) can read the design docs and score them,
e.g.

|               | reviewer 1 | reviewer 2 | ... |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --- |
| **Cool Lang** |            |            |     |
| creativity    | (1-3)      | (1-3)      | ... |
| uniqueness    | (1-3)      | (1-3)      | ... |
| **Fun Lang**  |            |            |     |
| creativity    | (1-3)      | (1-3)      | ... |
| uniqueness    | (1-3)      | (1-3)      | ... |
