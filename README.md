# PL JAM #1

## OVERVIEW

The #language-makers programming language jam is a

- low key
- small scope
- max creativity

opportunity to hack on a programming language.

## THEME

- @TODO

## SCHEDULE

### Week 1: design doc

Week #1 is primarily for thinking deeply and writing ideas down. This could
include

- description
- inspiration
- novel features
- example syntax

Submit a link to your design doc in #language-makers and tag your organizers
`@Jake` and `@Jason Steving`. We accept any reasonable format including github
READMEs and google docs. Please explain how your PL connects to the jam's theme.

### Week 2: implementation

In week #2 take a swing at implementing a runtime, interpreter, compiler, or
transpiler for your language. Compilers can take decades to write so nobody is
expecting the next python -- even getting even a single contrived program to run
is a huge accomplishment.

### Rules

- PL must be original
  - please do not submit a PL you already made
- PL must adhere to theme
  - include an explanation of how your PL fits the theme in the design doc
- Submission must include at least 1 sample program and clear steps about how to
  run it
- You may work in teams

### Judging

The judges will be evaluating submissions based on

- Creativity
- Comprehensibility
- Judges' Personal Tastes

### Awards ceremony

While the judges deliberate we encourage everyone to explore all the submissions
-- no prize is better than having people try your language! At the end of the
week we'll have a video call where we'll announce the winning language and
prize!
